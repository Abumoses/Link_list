# Linked List Operations in C

This project implements basic **singly linked list operations** using the C programming language. A linked list is a linear data structure where each element (node) contains data and a pointer to the next node.

## What is a Linked List?

A **Linked List** is a collection of nodes where:
- Each node contains:
  - **Data**: the value
  - **Next**: a pointer to the next node
- The last node points to `NULL`, marking the end of the list.

Linked lists are useful for dynamic memory usage and efficient insertions and deletions.

## Implemented Operations

- **Insertion at the beginning**
- **Insertion at the end**
- **Insertion at a given position**
- **Deletion from the beginning**
- **Deletion from the end**
- **Deletion at a given position**
- **Traversal (display all nodes)**
- **Search for an element**
- **Write linklist to file**
- **Read link list from file**

## Technologies Used

- **Language**: C
- **Compiler**: GCC (or any C compiler)
- **Libraries**: `stdio.h`, `stdlib.h`
